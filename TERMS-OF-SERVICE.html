<div class="doc-title-big">7. Custom Systems Developed by You</div>
<div class="doc-txt-medium">
    A "Custom System" is anything developed by you using the Site including, but not limited to: Ranking Systems,
    Trading
    Systems, Screens, Models, and Simulations. A "Private Custom System" is a Custom System that is not accessible to
    other
    users. This is typically accomplished by setting the visibility property to "private". The Company shall not be
    liable
    for any damages whatsoever, whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive or exemplary
    damages,
    in any way arising out of any of your Private Custom Systems being accessible to other users, regardless on how this
    access is achieved (for example due to an error in the Site, unauthorized access, theft, negligence, etc.), or by
    the
    loss or corruption of such Private Custom System.
    <br><br>

    It's the company's policy not to access Private Custom Systems internally or make their content available to any
    third
    parties, except in cases where access might help in identifying errors. The Company reserves the right to publish on
    the
    Site performance figures associated with any Custom System whether private or public.

    <br><br>

    A Public Custom System you create will be available to other users of the Site and will be attributed to you under
    your
    user name. You grant the Company, its successors, assignees and its affiliates a nonexclusive, royalty-free,
    perpetual,
    irrevocable, and fully sub-licensable and transferable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate,
    create derivative works of, distribute, and display such Public Custom System throughout the world in any media.
    You grant the Company and its affiliates and sublicensees the right to use the name that you submit in connection
    with
    such Puvlic Custom System. You represent that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the Public Custom
    System
    that you post; that use of the Public Custom System you supply does not violate the Site's Terms of Use.
    <br><br>
    A Private Custom System becomes a Public Custom System if the visibility property is set to "public" at any time,
    and
    only temporarely, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. It is your responsibility to verify that your Private Custom
    Systems have the visibility set to private.
    You agree that no payment or compensation of any kind is due to you from the Company or any third party now or at
    any
    time in the future as a result of developing any Custom Systems. The Company may make your Public Custom System a
    Private Custom System, and thereby not accessible to other users of the Site, at any time without prior notification
    to
    you.
